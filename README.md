# public-app-panel-diagnostics
Diagnostic scripts for reconstructing panel data and identifying structural inconsistencies in Korean public app performance records (2017–2024).
This repository provides reproducible analysis code used as a supplementary diagnostic instrument for validating App-ID reconstruction and error patterns in an EA-based study of public app management systems.
The code is provided for transparency and reproducibility purposes only.
Each script corresponds to a specific analytical step described in Sections 4.4–5.2 of the paper.
